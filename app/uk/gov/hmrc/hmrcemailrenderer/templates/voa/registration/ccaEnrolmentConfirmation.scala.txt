Valuation Office Agency – check and challenge registration

Dear @params("name"),

As part of the registration for the check and challenge service, you’ve been given a personal ID number. You should keep a note of this number in a safe place as you’ll need it if you want to reset your password.

Your ID number is @params("personId")

You will not need it to sign in to the check and challenge service – you should continue to use your Government Gateway details to sign in.
